pro version - nesbox/TIC-80 GitHub Wiki

To help support TIC-80 development, we have a PRO Version. This version has a few additional features and binaries can only be downloaded via our Itch.io page.
Please, consider supporting the developer by buying the PRO version or by becoming a sponsor.

For users who can't spend the money, we made it easy to build the pro version from the source code: (cmake .. -DBUILD_PRO=On)
Pro features

    Save/load cartridges in text format, and create your game in any external editor you want, also useful for version control systems.
    Even more memory banks: instead of having only 1 memory bank you have 8. You can switch banks in the editors or in code using sync. The code is not split into banks to you get 8 times longer code size directly in the editor.
    Export your game without editors, and then publish it to app stores using the alone=1 parameter of the export command.
